# About

*
NB: This is raw component, i don't think it's good idea to use it as is. But I hope it will be inspiration for your own implementation.
Suggested usage is for you to copy component code to your app, install dependences into your main app. Tweak component for your needs.

Vue component for Medium-style lazy loading pictures.

Uses `<picture>` tag and `<canvas>` for blurred image.
Image detection by instersection observer API.

Created for using with contentful.com api initially, that why `fields` and `sys` are used as object property names.

Demo: https://andreynazarov3.github.io/lazy-picture/dist/index.html

```
<template>
	<div id="app">
		<lazy-picture :key="index" v-for="(index) of [1,2,3,4,5]" :sources="sources" :lazy="true"></lazy-picture>
	</div>
</template>

<script>
import lazyPicture from "./components/LazyPicture.vue";

export default {
	name: "app",
	components: {
		lazyPicture
	},
	data() {
		return {
			sources: [
				{
					fields: {
						src: "./images/New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg",
						placeholder: "./images/rsz_new_york_times_square-terabass-small.jpg"
					},
					sys: {
						id: "1"
					}
				}
			]
		};
	}
};
</script>
```

# Dependencies

- stackblur-canvas: draws blurred image to canvas
- intersection-observer: polyfill for iOS and others
- gsap: opacity animation

# Props

- `title (String)` - alt attribute for image
- `sources (Array)` - array of image source objects.
- `lazy (Boolean)` - should image loading be lazy or not

Image source object schema:

```lang=json
{
  fields: {
    media: String - ex. (max-width: 480px)
    src: String (for Base Image without media query)
    srcset: String - ex. image.jpg, image@2x.jpg
    placeholder: String (path for low-res image)
  },
  sys: {
    id: String
  }
}
```

# Note

_Base Image_ - is an image that will be placed in `<img>` tag inside `<picture>`. It will be used when no media queries are suitable and also as a fallback image for older browsers.

`src` property should be only in one source object. It is used to determine base image.

```lang="javascript"
baseImage: function() {
      return this.sources.find(source => source.fields.src);
    },
```
